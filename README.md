# Mathematica-packages

Packages for computing with symmetric functions, and  combinatorics


## SymmetricFunctions.m

This is a package for working with symmetric functions.
It has the standard bases, Jack and Macdonald polynomials, LLT polynomials,
SchurP and SchurQ functions, the Hall inner product, plethysm 
and the Delta operator.


## CombinatoricsUtil.m

Functions for permutation statistics (major index, inversions, Bruhat order, etc.), 
compositions, partitions, q-analogs, the Foata map,
and various helper functions.


## NewTableaux.m

Functions for generating standard Young tableaux, semi-standard Young tableaux,
RSK, promotion and crystal operators.



## CatalanObjects.m

Various different families of Catalan objects,
and ways to draw them.



## ChromaticFunctions.m

Chromatic (quasi)symmetric functions and LLT polynomials
associated with unit interval graphs.
Various functions related to unit-interval graphs.


## MacdonaldPolynomials.m

This is an older package, and not very up to date.
It has Schubert polynomials, permuted-basement Macdonald polynomials,
and various non-symmetric polynomials.

## Tex2WebUtilities.m

I use this mainly for generating the bibliography on the Symmetric functions catalog.
It can parse .bib-files and produce an associative array
of the data. 
There are also functions for converting `ytableau` syntax to HTML.


## PosetData.m

This is a file which mainly contains non-isomorphic posets.

## TreesData.m

This is a file which mainly contains non-isomorphic trees.
